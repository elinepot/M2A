    "\n",
    "This is the first lab of a series of four labs dedicated to the simulation of Parabolic Partial Differential equations using discretization schemes. We start with the simplest situation where we use the explicit scheme with global memory. Even with this simple example, multiple optimizations can be considered to reduce the execution time. These optimizations will be implemented step by step starting with the naive implementation of PDE_diff_k1 much improved in PDE_diff_k2 which is also improved in PDE_diff_k3. In addition to kernels, students need only to comment or to uncomment three lines in the wrapper function + CPU2GPU end GPU2CPU memory transfer. Neither the main function nor the NP function should be modified.\n",
